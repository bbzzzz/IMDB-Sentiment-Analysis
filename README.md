Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning
====================================
* Naive Bayes
* Add-1 smoothing
* 10-fold cross validation
* regular expression detecting negation words

* Boolean Naive Bayes
* Naive Bayes with stop word

Accuracy: 
    * Regualr NB: 81.65%
    * Boolean NB: 73.85%
    * NB with stop word filterd: 81.10%
