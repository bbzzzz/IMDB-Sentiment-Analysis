Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes
====================================
* Naive Bayes
* Add-1 smoothing
* 10-fold cross validation
* regular expression detecting negation words

Besides the regular Naive Bayes method, the code also realized: 
* Boolean Naive Bayes
* Naive Bayes with stop word
* Naive Bayes with negation features (not, never, n't)

Accuracy: 
 * Regualr NB: 81.65%
 * Boolean NB: 73.85%
 * NB with stop word filterd: 81.10%
 * NB with negation features: 81.80%    

Support Vector Machine:
====================================
* sklearn LinearSVC
* 10-fold cross validation
* accuracy 88.45%
